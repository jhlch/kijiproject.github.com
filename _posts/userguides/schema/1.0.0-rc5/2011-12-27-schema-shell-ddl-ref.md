description: An introduction to the DDL that manipulates table layouts.
---

The KijiSchema DDL Shell implements a _data definition language_ (DDL) that
allows you to create, modify, inspect, and delete kiji table layouts. A
_table layout_ is the KijiSchema data dictionary element that defines a set
of column families, qualifiers, etc. and associates these columns with
Avro schemas.

With this shell, you can quickly create tables to use in your KijiSchema
applications. You can add, drop, or modify columns quickly too. These
modifications can be performed without any downtime associated with the
table; the only exception is that modifying a locality group causes
the table to be taken offline while applying changes. But locality group
changes should be rare in running applications.

Finally, this shell allows you to quickly understand the layout of an
existing table. The `DESCRIBE` command will pretty-print the layout of a
table, eliminating the guesswork as to where your coworker has stashed an
important piece of data.


## Running

* Export `$KIJI_HOME` to point to your KijiSchema installation.
* Run `bin/kiji-schema-shell`

This command takes a few options (e.g., to load a script out of a file).
Run `bin/kiji-schema-shell --help` for all the available options.

### An Example

The following commands could be entered at the DDL shell prompt to create
a table, add another column family, describe its layout, and then remove the
table.

    CREATE TABLE foo WITH DESCRIPTION 'some data'
    ROW KEY FORMAT HASHED
    WITH LOCALITY GROUP default WITH DESCRIPTION 'main storage' (
      MAXVERSIONS = INFINITY,
      TTL = FOREVER,
      INMEMORY = false,
      COMPRESSED WITH GZIP,
      FAMILY info WITH DESCRIPTION 'basic information' (
        name "string" WITH DESCRIPTION 'The user\'s name',
        email "string",
        age "int"),
      MAP TYPE FAMILY integers COUNTER WITH DESCRIPTION 'metric tracking data'
    );

    ALTER TABLE foo ADD MAP TYPE FAMILY strings { "type" : "string" }
      WITH DESCRIPTION 'ad-hoc string data' TO LOCALITY GROUP default;

    SHOW TABLES;
    DESCRIBE EXTENDED foo;
    DROP TABLE foo;
    SHOW TABLES;


## The Layout Definition Language

This section defines the layout definition language.

### General Language Notes and Style

All statements in the language must end with a semi-colon character.
Statements may wrap across multiple lines.

Keywords are case insensitive. The following are equivalent:

    schema> DESCRIBE foo;
    schema> describe foo;

Names for tables and columns are case sensitive. The following are _different_:

    schema> DESCRIBE FOO;
    schema> DESCRIBE foo;

Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.

    schema> # this is a comment line and will be ignored.
    schema> # the next line will not be ignored.
    schema> show tables;


Table and column names can be provided either as identifiers or
`'in single quotes'`. The following are equivalent:

    schema> DESCRIBE foo;
    schema> DESCRIBE 'foo';

If you have a table whose name is a keyword (e.g., "SHOW" or "tables"),
you can wrap them `'in single quotes'` to protect them. e.g.:

    schema> CREATE TABLE 'WITH' WITH DESCRIPTION 'A table with a silly name';

By contrast, strings used to specify table or column descriptions, or other
string "values" must always be single quoted.

Quoted strings may contain `'internally \'escaped quotes\', as well as escaped slashes:\\'`.

The escape sequences `'\t'` and `'\n'` work as you'd hope, representing a tab
character and a newline character respectively. Everything else escapes to itself.

`INFINITY` and `FOREVER` are both synonyms for Int.MaxValue wherever an integer
may be specified.

Avro schemas are specified with the Avro JSON schema syntax. JSON uses "double quotes"
to enclose strings; this is respected in this shell as well. JSON can be entered directly
into the command. For example:

    ALTER TABLE foo ADD MAP TYPE FAMILY strings { "type" : "string" }
      WITH DESCRIPTION 'ad-hoc string data' TO LOCALITY GROUP default;


For more information, see
[The Avro 1.7 specification](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.2/spec.html).

## Layout Definition Language Statements

### Working with Kiji Instances

A kiji instance is a collection of kiji tables. You can list the available
instances:

    schema> SHOW INSTANCES;

The currently selected instance will have an asterisk next to it.

You can also select an instance:

    schema> USE foo;

The default instance is named `default`; in addition to `USE default;`,
you can also select that with the more readable (and more verbose) syntax:

    schema> USE DEFAULT INSTANCE;


### Listing and Describing Tables

You can list the available tables with:

    schema> SHOW TABLES;

You can pretty-print the layout of a table with:

    schema> DESCRIBE foo;

This will not print locality group information or hidden columns. To include
this information, use:

    schema> DESCRIBE EXTENDED foo;


### Creating Tables

This shell will allow you to create tables and define their locality groups,
column families, and column qualifiers. Each map-type family or qualifier in a
group-type family has a schema associated with it.

#### Schemas

There are three possible kinds of schemas that can be associated with a
column:

* JSON schemas are declared inline. e.g. `"string"` or `{ "type" : "int" }`
* Avro SpecificRecord class names are declared as `CLASS com.example.FooRecord`
* A special type `COUNTER` can define an HBase counter column that can be
  atomically incremented.

#### Names

Table, locality group, family, and column names must have the following
format:

    [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

The following are legal names:

    foo
    meep123
    wom_bat
    _aard_vark
    users2

The following are not allowed:

    42
    2users
    some-dashed-name
    this$uses!special(characters_)

#### `CREATE TABLE` Syntax

    CREATE TABLE t [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd']
    [ROW KEY FORMAT { HASHED | RAW | HASH PREFIXED(int) | formatted_key_spec }]
    WITH locality_group [ , locality_group ...]*;

This creates a table, sets its description, defines how row keys are formatted,
and defines a list of locality groups.

##### Row key syntax

Row keys are generally a tuple of one or more string or numeric values, which are usually
prefixed by a few bytes of salt for load balancing purposes. The salt is calculated
by hashing one or more elements of the tuple and using a few bytes of the hash.

A `formatted_key_spec` looks something like this:

    ROW KEY FORMAT (component_name STRING, component_name2 INT, ..., HASH (hash_props))

The row key must have at least one component. Each component in the key tuple must have a name
that matches `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Components may have one of the following types:

* `STRING` - A UTF-8-encoded string that does not contain the codepoint `\u0000` ('nil').
* `INT` - A 32-bit signed integer.
* `LONG` - A 64-bit signed integer.
* Additionally, components may be marked `NOT NULL` (e.g., `foo STRING NOT NULL`). The
  first element is implicitly `NOT NULL`. Subsequent elements may be marked as such,
  but `NOT NULL` elements may not follow nullable ones.

And `hash_props` is a collection of the following properties:

* `THROUGH component_name` - Specifies that the hash prefix is calculated through all
  fields up to and including `component_name`. By default, the hash prefix will be
  calculated based on the first field.
* `SIZE = n` - Specifies the number of bytes to use in the hash prefix, between 0 and 16 inclusive.
  If not given, this defaults to 2 bytes.
* `SUPPRESS FIELDS` - If specified, then the "plain text" of your key is discarded; only the
  hash of the key is used. If `SIZE` is not specified but `SUPPRESS FIELDS` is, the entire 16
  byte hash will be retained. Do not use this if you need to read the keys out of the table;
  only use this if recording the hashes alone is sufficient.
* Each of the above 3 properties may be specified at most once.

There are also a few "canned" row key formats available:

* `ROW KEY FORMAT HASH PREFIXED(n)` - Use a single string component in the key, and
  include a hash-based salt prefix. `n` specifies the number of bytes of salt. This should
  be at least 2 bytes. More than 4 is probably overkill.
* `ROW KEY FORMAT HASHED` - Use a single string component in the key, but rather than
  include the string component in the key -- just use the 16 byte hash of the string.
  If you need to read back the value in the key, prefer `HASH PREFIXED` over `HASHED`.
* `ROW KEY FORMAT RAW` - Use a literal raw byte array for the key. Appropriate for advanced
  manual control over row keys; use at your own caution.
* If no `ROW KEY FORMAT` clause is given, it is assumed to be `HASHED`.

Example row keys:

    # A simple row key consisting of a single, hash-prefixed component:
    CREATE TABLE ex0 ROW KEY FORMAT (username STRING) WITH LOCALITY GROUP...

    # A composite row key:
    CREATE TABLE ex1 ROW KEY FORMAT (lastname STRING, firstname STRING) WITH LOCALITY GROUP...

    # Key components are implicitly strings; this is equivalent:
    CREATE TABLE ex1a ROW KEY FORMAT (lastname, firstname) WITH LOCALITY GROUP...

    # The hash prefix is calculated based on (state, zip), not just 'state'.
    # Note that 'state' is implicitly NOT NULL since it's the first element:
    CREATE TABLE ex2 ROW KEY FORMAT (state STRING, zip INT NOT NULL, HASH(THROUGH zip)) ...

    # Equivalent to "ROW KEY FORMAT HASHED":
    CREATE TABLE ex3 ROW KEY FORMAT (key STRING, HASH(SUPPRESS FIELDS)) ...

    # Include a bigger hash (4 bytes) than the default (2 bytes):
    CREATE TABLE ex4 ROW KEY FORMAT (category_id LONG, product_id LONG, HASH(SIZE=4)) ...

    # Setting many options:
    CREATE TABLE ex5 ROW KEY FORMAT (a STRING, b LONG NOT NULL, c INT, HASH(THROUGH b, SIZE=8)) ...

    # Row key component names can also be 'single quoted', like other identifiers:
    CREATE TABLE ex6 ROW KEY FORMAT ('a' STRING) ...

As a final word of caution, please note that after a table is created, its row key format
cannot be altered.

##### Locality group definition syntax

Each locality group is defined as follows:

    LOCALITY GROUP foo [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd'] [ ( property, property... ) ]

This defines a locality group named `foo` with one or more properties set. The
valid properties are:

    MAXVERSIONS = int
    INMEMORY = bool
    TTL = int
    COMPRESSED WITH (GZIP | LZO | SNAPPY | NONE)

Remember that you can use `INFINITY` and `FOREVER` when specifying integer
values for `MAXVERSIONS` and `TTL` to make your statements more readable.

You can also specify map- and group-type column families in the properties
list:

    [GROUP TYPE] FAMILY f [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd'] [( column, column... )]
    MAP TYPE FAMILY f [WITH SCHEMA] schema [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd']


Within a group-type family, individual column qualifiers are specified with:

    [COLUMN] foo [WITH SCHEMA] schema [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd']


#### `CREATE TABLE` Example

The following is an example that puts together all of the different syntax
elements described in the previous section:

    schema> CREATE TABLE users WITH DESCRIPTION 'some data'
         -> ROW KEY FORMAT (username STRING, HASH(SIZE=3))
         -> WITH LOCALITY GROUP default WITH DESCRIPTION 'main storage' (
         ->     MAXVERSIONS = INFINITY,
         ->     TTL = FOREVER,
         ->     INMEMORY = false,
         ->     COMPRESSED WITH GZIP,
         ->     FAMILY info WITH DESCRIPTION 'basic information' (
         ->         name "string" WITH DESCRIPTION 'The user\'s name',
         ->         email "string",
         ->         addr CLASS com.example.AddressRecord,
         ->         age "int"),
         ->     MAP TYPE FAMILY integers COUNTER WITH DESCRIPTION 'metric tracking data'
         -> );

### Deleting Tables

You can delete a table with the command:

    schema> DROP TABLE foo;

Warning: THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE DATA IN THE TABLE.

### Changing Table Properties

All table properties that can be set (descriptions, columns & schemas,
locality group properties, etc) when a table is created, can also be changed
after the fact.

Row keys are the exception to this: their format is final.

Keywords or clauses in \[square brackets\] are optional in the examples below:


    ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN info:foo [WITH SCHEMA] schema [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd'];
    ALTER TABLE t RENAME COLUMN info:foo [AS] info:bar;
    ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN info:foo;

    ALTER TABLE t ADD [GROUP TYPE] FAMILY f [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd'] TO [LOCALITY GROUP] lg;

    ALTER TABLE t ADD MAP TYPE FAMILY f [WITH SCHEMA] schema
        [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd'] TO [LOCALITY GROUP] lg;

    ALTER TABLE t DROP FAMILY f;
    ALTER TABLE t RENAME FAMILY f [AS] f2;

    ALTER TABLE t CREATE LOCALITY GROUP lg [WITH DESCRIPTION 'd']
        [( property, property... )]

    ... Where 'property' is one of:
          MAXVERSIONS = int
        | INMEMORY = bool
        | TTL = int
        | COMPRESSED WITH { GZIP | LZO | SNAPPY | NONE }
    ... or a FAMILY definition (see the earlier section on the CREATE TABLE syntax)

    ALTER TABLE t RENAME LOCALITY GROUP lg [AS] lg2;
    ALTER TABLE t DROP LOCALITY GROUP lg;

    ALTER TABLE t SET DESCRIPTION = 'desc' FOR FAMILY f;
    ALTER TABLE t SET SCHEMA = schema FOR [MAP TYPE] FAMILY fREATE TABLE ex1 ROW KEY FORMAT (a
    STRING, b STRING) WITH LOCALITY GROUP...


    ALTER TABLE t SET DESCRIPTION = 'desc' FOR COLUMN info:foo;
    ALTER TABLE t SET SCHEMA = schema FOR COLUMN info:foo;

    ALTER TABLE t SET DESCRIPTION = 'desc';

    ALTER TABLE t SET DESCRIPTION = 'desc' FOR LOCALITY GROUP lg;
    ALTER TABLE t SET property FOR LOCALITY GROUP lg;
    ... where 'property' is one of MAXVERSIONS, INMEMORY, TTL, or COMPRESSED WITH.


### Working With Scripts

You can write scripts that contain DDL statements to define tables or whole
instances. If you put a sequence of DDL statements in a file, you can run
this file with:

    schema> LOAD FROM FILE '/path/to/foo.ddl';

You can print the DDL that would create a whole instance or a specific table
to the screen:

    schema> DUMP DDL;
    schema> DUMP DDL FOR TABLE foo;

Or you can save the output to a file:

    schema> DUMP DDL TO FILE '/path/to/foo.ddl';
    schema> DUMP DDL FOR TABLE foo TO FILE '/path/to/foo.ddl';
